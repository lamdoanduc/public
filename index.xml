      <description>1. What is Chi-square?  Assume that we observe an example of a categorical variable that has N different values, 1 through N. Each value has an expected (theoretical) frequency and an observed frequency. We can display them as the following table:      value 1 value 2 &amp;hellip; value N     Observed frequency O_1 O_2 &amp;hellip; O_N   expected frequency E_1 E_2 &amp;hellip; E_N     Chi-Square is the sum of the squared difference between the observed and expected frequency divided by the number of values of the variable: $$\chi^2 = \sum^{N}_{j=1} \frac{(O_j - E_j)^2}{E_j}$$  2.</description>

      <description>Problem 1 (proportions)  A study shows the effect of a new drug on the treatment of a disease in two groups of patients: the first group received the drug and the other received placebo (no drug). The table below is the results:      n_patients n_cured proportion     new drug 250 150 0.60   placebo 245 118 0.48      We want to test if the new drug has a positive effect on the treatment or the result just happens by chance.</description>

      <title>Student&#39;s t-distribution and Confidence intervals using t-score</title>

      <description>What is the T-distribution?   T-distribution is known as the Student distribution. T-distribution allows for use of small samples (n &amp;lt; 30) with an unknown standard deviation of population, however it does so by sacrificing certainty with a margin-of-error trade-off. It also has a bell-shaped distribution as normal distribution and it converges into a normal distribution when sample size n is high.
  Probability density function: $$ f(t) = \frac {\varGamma(\frac{v+1}{2})}{\sqrt{v\pi}\varGamma(\frac{v}{2})} (1+\frac{t^2}{v})^{-\frac{v+1}{2}}$$ Where $$\varGamma$$ is the gamma function, and v = n-1 is the number of degrees of freedom.</description>

      <description>Problem 1 (proportions) Before an election, a candidate performed a poll to see how many percentages of voters plan on voting for him. The poll asked 500 people, the result shows that there is 54% of eligible voters gonna vote for him. He wants to do a hypothesis test to see if he&amp;rsquo;s gonna have an opportunity to win the election.
Approach Use one-tailed hypothesis test (Z test)
Step 1:   Define the hypotheses:</description>

      <description>The visualisation shows the Amazon&amp;rsquo;s business model. The company is barely profitable. This is because it reinvests its profits rapidly into new innovative products. I made this for a #Makeover-Monday which is a weekly social data project. Click the link here for an interactive version of the plots.

      <description>This is a visualisation of the last 40-year history of music industry. I made this for a #Makeover-Monday which is a weekly social data project. The visualisation shows how the musics industry has changed in its revenue with different music format. The digital format prepares for an end of physical format.

      <title>Project III: Predict eCommerce price</title>
      <link>https://lamdoanduc.github.io/public/portfolio/project3/</link>

      <description>Goal: The blooming of e-commerce platforms over the last 2 decades makes the market become very competitive. To dominate the market they must provide customer with goods at lower prices. This project uses the data from an e-commerce platform to predict the goods price based on given features in the data.
Data: The data contains contains 2452 observations with 7 columns (features) and a target variable, Selling_price.
  Method: The exploratory data analysis (EDA) showed a highly skewed distribution of the selling price.</description>

      <title>Project II: Anomalies in ERP reports</title>
      <link>https://lamdoanduc.github.io/public/portfolio/project2/</link>

      <description>Overview and Objective: The data shows the business performance of an online shop in 2018. The shop manager has noticed anomalies in their ERP reports, and she is worried about the reliability of the data. The data consists of three dataset: CustomerData, ItemData, and TransactionData. The case-study goals are:
(1) We need to understand the data and develop a comprehensive understanding of the information provided.
(2) From this understanding we need to identify anomalies, consider important relationships, and report on any concern.</description>

      <title>Project I: Loan status prediction</title>
      <link>https://lamdoanduc.github.io/public/portfolio/project1/</link>

      <description>Goal: A model can predict wether or not a borrower will pay back his/her loan. The model is trained with a given historical data that has information on whether or not the borrowers defaulted. The model can be used in the future to assess if a new customer is likely to pay back the loan.
Method: A deep neural network is used to address the problem. Since the data is imbalanced, it will be resampled (both under-sampled and over-sampled) to get better results of prediction.</description>

      <description>Task:  Build a predictive model capable of distinguishing between &amp;lsquo;bad&amp;rsquo; connections, called intrusions or attacks, and &amp;lsquo;good&amp;rsquo; normal connections. Differentiate between both the normal traffic and among distinct types of attack (predict the actual types (22 types) of attack).  Data:  The dataset was acquired, by Lincoln Labs, for nine weeks of raw TCP dump data for a local-area network (LAN) simulating a typical U.S. Air Force LAN. This Link is for more information about the data.</description>
